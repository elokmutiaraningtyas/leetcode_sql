-- solution and explanation
select b.product_id, 
       b.first_year, 
       a.quantity,
       a.price
  -- select prefered column
from (select product_id, 
      min(year) as first_year
      from Sales
      group by product_id) as b,  -- create subquery to get the first transaction of each product_id using MIN()
      Sales as a -- get the other column from original table
where a.product_id = b.product_id -- you can connect 2 table using WHERE id = id and year = year
and a.year = b.first_year
