In this repository, I provide clear documentation and explanations to help anyone (including future me) understand not just the solution â€” but the thinking process behind it.
By writing clean, well-commented SQL and pairing it with explanations, I hope to:
  * Reinforce best practices in SQL
  * Help others learning SQL by showing why something is written a certain way
  * Build a strong data portfolio that reflects not just code skills, but communication too
