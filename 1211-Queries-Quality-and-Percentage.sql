1211. Queries Quality and Percentage

Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
Output: 
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
Explanation: 
Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

SELECT query_name, -- select the column that you want to show
    ROUND((SUM(rating/position)/COUNT(query_name)),2) AS quality, -- write an aggregation to show quality. The calculation is "the total of (rating/position ), divided by total pet type (cat/dog), then round it to 2 decimal places          
    ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)*100,2) AS poor_query_percentage -- then percentage, the "poor query" with criteria, having "rating" less than 3, and then average it. In SQL, to averaging value with certain criteria, you can use "AVG(CASE WHEN column1 = ... THEN xxx ELSE xxx END)"
FROM Queries -- FROM table name
GROUP BY 1 -- dont forget to write group by in the end because we have aggregations column on the select, group by the 1st column since its not aggregation
